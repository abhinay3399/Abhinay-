### Navigating My OS on the Command Line

1. Full / absolute path to your user's home directory: 
2. Create a directory named `DirA`: mkdir DirA
3. Create a directory named `Dir B`: mkdir Dir B
4. Go into `DirA`: cd DirA
5. Go into `Dir B` from `DirA`:cd ../Dir B
6. Return to your user's home directory: cd %USERPROFILE%
7. Create a file named `test.txt`: notepad.exe test.txt
8. Move the file named `test.txt` into `DirA`:move test.txt DirA/test.txt 
9. Contents of `test.txt`: echo hello >> test.txt
```
hello
```
10. Make a copy of `test.txt` named `copy.txt` in `DirA`: copy test.txt copy.txt
11. View the contents of `DirA`: cd dirA; ls
12. Make a copy of `test.txt` in `Dir B` named `fodder.txt`: copy DirA/test.txt "Dir B/fodder.txt"
13. Delete / remove both `fodder.txt` AND `Dir B`: Remove-Item "Dir B"
